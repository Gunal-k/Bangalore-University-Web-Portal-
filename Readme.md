# Bangalore-University-Web-Portal-

As part of my internship, I designed and developed a web portal for Bangalore University using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and PHP. The portal was created primarily for PC users and aimed to enhance the accessibility of student services like course registrations, notifications, and academic records.

Throughout the project, I utilized XAMPP for local development and testing, which helped streamline the testing process before deployment. The experience was invaluable in terms of not only applying my web development skills but also managing a team to ensure the project met the university's requirements.

During the project, I learned how to integrate front-end and back-end technologies effectively, ensuring smooth user interaction and functionality. I also gained significant experience in team management, coordinating with teammates, and handling the design and development phases to meet deadlines.

Overall, this project helped me gain a deeper understanding of web development processes, improve my problem-solving skills, and learn how to work in a collaborative environment, making it an essential part of my internship experience.
